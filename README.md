This is the first ever Minecraft mod that I've created. It is made for Minecraft v1.12.2

# Features
- 5 Running Shoe Types:
	- Base Running Shoes
	- Leather Running Shoes
	- Gold Running Shoes
	- Iron Running Shoes
	- Diamond Running Shoes
- 5 Sprinting Shoe Types:
	- Same as running shoes, but gives a great speed boost.
- Each pair of running shoes gives the same base speed (default speed * 1.5). Sprinting shoes are more expensive variants that boost run speed by 300% (default speed * 3).
- Different tiers are so you get armor values equal to that of the vanilla boots of the same tier.
	- Don't have to make the trade-off between speed vs armor.
- Stacks with other methods of increasing speed (such as potions).
